# MechSheets
The Mech Sheets application is  a non-commercial, open source application (released under CC-BY-NC-4.0 license) 
designed to make game play of the Classic BattleTech table top game (by Catalyst Game Labs) easier when paper 
record sheets are not an option.  This application is fan made to make the authors life easier and hopefully 
can be of use to others.
